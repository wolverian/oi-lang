    <p>This page documents how Oi will change next. Exciting! 😻</p>

    <div>
        <h2>Mutation</h2>

        <p>
            This is the largest missing fundamental piece. Oi is, at its heart, an old-fashioned language and wants to mutate things. This means setting slots on objects. Concretely, the <code>setSlot</code> method on <code>initial</code> needs to be implemented.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Errors</h2>

        <p>
            Oi doesn't help much with errors right now. 🙁 It'd be great to get descriptive errors, at least for simple cases like mistyped method names.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Usability</h2>

        <p>For Oi to be usable in any real sense, we need a standard library! For an example, right now, <code>list</code>s have no methods at all! Not even a <code>map</code> method. 😱</p>

        <p>It'd be best if we could implement as much as possible of the standard library in Oi itself. Some way to load Oi code is needed, then. On that note, there's no way to run an Oi file yet either!</p>
